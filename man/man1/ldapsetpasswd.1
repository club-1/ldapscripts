.SH LIMITATIONS
When used interactively, passwords generated with this command are propagated with the ldappasswd(1) command.
Thus, the resulting format depends on the 'password-hash' option of your server's slapd.conf(5) file.

You can always force an encoded password (using the hash format of your choice) by specifying it on the command line.

No bug known.
